AWS S3 Image Upload with Node.js & React
Description
This project demonstrates a full-stack web application for uploading, updating, and deleting images using AWS S3, Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and React. It includes both the backend and frontend, providing a seamless user interface for uploading images and managing them in a cloud environment.

Key Features
Image Upload: Users can upload images to an AWS S3 bucket through the frontend interface. The images are securely stored in the cloud and associated metadata is saved in a relational database (using Sequelize ORM).

Image Management: Users can update images (upload new ones to replace old ones) or delete images. All actions are reflected in the AWS S3 bucket as well as in the database.

Frontend with React: The frontend uses React for building the user interface, including features like image previews, upload forms, and edit dialogs.

Backend with Node.js & Express: The backend uses Express to handle API requests for uploading, updating, and deleting images. AWS SDK is used to interact with the S3 bucket, and Sequelize manages the database.

Technologies Used
Backend
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building the server-side logic.
Express: Web framework for handling API routes.
AWS SDK: Used for interacting with AWS S3 for image storage.
Multer: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data, used for file uploads.
Sequelize: ORM for managing image metadata in a relational database.
PostgreSQL (or any other SQL database supported by Sequelize).
Frontend
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
MUI: Material UI library for styling the components and building a responsive interface.
Cloud & Storage
AWS S3: Cloud storage service for storing uploaded images.
AWS IAM: Role-based access control for managing permissions for S3 operations.

Environment Variables
To run this project, you need to configure the following environment variables in a .env file in the server directory:

bash
Copy code
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=<Your AWS Access Key>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<Your AWS Secret Access Key>
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=<Your S3 Bucket Name>
AWS_BUCKET_REGION=<Your S3 Bucket Region>
DATABASE_URL=<Your Database Connection URL>
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
AWS S3: Set up an AWS account, create an S3 bucket, and configure appropriate IAM permissions.
PostgreSQL: Set up a PostgreSQL database or any other database supported by Sequelize.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aws-s3-image-upload.git
cd aws-s3-image-upload
Install backend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd server
npm install
Install frontend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd client
npm install
Set up environment variables: In the server folder, create a .env file and add your AWS credentials, database URL, and S3 bucket information.

API Endpoints
The following endpoints are available for interacting with images:

POST /upload: Upload a new image.
PUT /images/:id: Update an existing image.
DELETE /images/:id: Delete an image.
GET /images: Get a list of all uploaded images.
Frontend Features
Upload Image: Users can select and upload an image through the React frontend.
Update Image: Users can update an image, which replaces the existing one in the S3 bucket.
Delete Image: Users can delete images, which will be removed from both S3 and the database.
Image List: The frontend fetches and displays all the images stored in the database.
