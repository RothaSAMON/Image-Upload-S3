# AWS S3 Image Upload with Node.js & React

## ***Description***

This project demonstrates a full-stack web application for uploading, updating, and deleting images using AWS S3, Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and React. It includes both the backend and frontend, providing a seamless user interface for uploading images and managing them in a cloud environment.

## ***Key Features***

**Image Upload:** Users can upload images to an AWS S3 bucket through the frontend interface. The images are securely stored in the cloud and associated metadata is saved in a relational database (using Sequelize ORM).

**Image Management:** Users can update images (upload new ones to replace old ones) or delete images. All actions are reflected in the AWS S3 bucket as well as in the database.

**Frontend with React:** The frontend uses React for building the user interface, including features like image previews, upload forms, and edit dialogs.

**Backend with Node.js & Express:** The backend uses Express to handle API requests for uploading, updating, and deleting images. AWS SDK is used to interact with the S3 bucket, and Sequelize manages the database.

## ***Technologies Used***

**Backend :**
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building the server-side logic.
Express: Web framework for handling API routes.
AWS SDK: Used for interacting with AWS S3 for image storage.
Multer: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data, used for file uploads.
Sequelize: ORM for managing image metadata in a relational database.
PostgreSQL (or any other SQL database supported by Sequelize).

**Frontend :**

React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
MUI: Material UI library for styling the components and building a responsive interface.
Cloud & Storage
AWS S3: Cloud storage service for storing uploaded images.
AWS IAM: Role-based access control for managing permissions for S3 operations.

## ***API Endpoints***
Here are the available **API endpoints** for interacting with the images:
```
POST /upload: Upload a new image.
PUT /images/:id: Update an existing image.
DELETE /images/:id: Delete an image.
GET /images: Retrieve a list of all uploaded images.
```
**Frontend Features**
```
Upload Image: Select and upload images through a simple form interface.
Update Image: Replace an existing image with a new one.
Delete Image: Remove an image from both the S3 bucket and the database.
Image List: The frontend fetches and displays all stored images.
```
